# NE.Standard.Design

A flexible abstraction layer for cross-platform MVVM applications.  
Allows describing user interfaces and bindings via configuration files, independent of any specific UI technology.  
Built on top of `RecursiveObservable`, it enables declarative, platform-agnostic models for state management and change tracking.
